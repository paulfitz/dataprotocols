title: Web Feature Service
layout: spec
author: OGC
summary: Service definition by the Open Geospatial Consortium that defines exchange (vector) data
---

Goals
=====

Goal is to unify the exchange of (vector) data over the web

Definition
==========

The Service has the following operations (for full details check the specification)

* GetCapabilities (Advertises supported operations, featuretypes, formats, etc)
* DescribeFeatureType (Returns the data model for a featuretype)
* GetFeature (Returns the requested Features)
* Transaction (Allows to add or modify a feature)

Most common is the use of GML as encoding of feature data. However most of the implementations also support GeoJSON, GeoPackage, CSV and/or KML (check capabilities).
