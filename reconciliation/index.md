This document is about providing a standardized way of (fuzzily)
matching a column in one dataset to a column in another dataset.

This is called "reconciling".

Refine API
==========

There is one obvious candidate standard, the reconciliation API used by
Google Refine.

<https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation-Service-API>

Refine essentially assigns a score integer value to each reconciliation
match. The boolean key match can also be added to signify responses that
have a high level of confidence.

To implement a reconciliation API you basically need a full text index
(most already return weighted match values that can be returned as the
score in a reconciliation API)
