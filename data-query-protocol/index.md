title: Data Query Protocol
layout: default
research: true

---

This document is about providing a proposal for a standardized way of
making queries to (heterogeneous) databases over HTTP. It is the need
for support for querying over HTTP that makes this a protocol rather
than just a language though it will build on or require a data query
language of some form.

The kind of use cases we are thinking of are:

-   Data viewers calling databases to get data to display.
-   Visualisation tools calling databases or data scraping tools.
-   Crowd sourcing tools augmenting information dynamically pulled from
    a data catalogue.

Introduction
============

Query support would involve supporting things like:

-   size (limit)
-   from (offset)
-   sorting (ordering by)
-   filtering
-   aggregation (sum, count, distinct)

Proposal
========

The proposal divides into 2 parts. First, the definition of a
JSON-serializable query object. Second, the presentation of that data to
a web accessible query endpoint.

Query Object
------------

The Proposal is heavily based on [ElasticSearch query
language](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/)

Query object has the following key attributes:

-   size (=limit): number of results to return
-   from (=offset): offset into result set
    -<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/from-size.html>
-   sort: sort order
    -<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/sort.html>
-   query: Query in ES Query DSL
    <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/query.html>
-   fields: set of fields to return
    -<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/fields.html>
-   facets: - see
    <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/>

Additions:

-   q: either straight text or a hash will map directly onto a
    [query\_string
    query](<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/query-string-query.html>)
    in backend

    -   Of course this can be re-interpreted by different backends. E.g.
        some may just pass this straight through e.g. for an SQL backend
        this could be the full SQL query

-   filters: dict of fields with for each one specified a filter like
    term, terms, prefix, range. This provides a quick way to do
    filtering.

    -   Value for a field can just be text in which case this becomes a
        term query on that field

        -   E.g. my-field: 'abc' - would only match results with abc in
            that field

### Examples

    {
       q: 'quick brown fox',
       filters: {
         'owner': 'jones'
       }
    }

Existing Work
=============

ElasticSearch
-------------

JSON oriented document store and search index.

-   <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/>
-   <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/>

Webstore
--------

Designed to expose RDBMS over RESTful HTTP.

-   <http://github.com/okfn/webstore>
-   Documentation (includes spec of query format):
    <http://webstore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>
-   Supports RESTful style as well as full SQL

SQL
---

Raw SQL over HTTP.

This is one in Scraperwiki and the
[Webstore](http://github.com/okfn/webstore).

DAP
---

DAP is a data transmission protocol designed speciﬁcally for science
data. The protocol relies on the widely used and stable HTTP and MIME
standards, and provides data types to accommodate gridded data,
relational data, and time series, as well as allowing users to deﬁne
their own data types.

-   <http://opendap.org/pdf/ESE-RFC-004v1.2.pdf>
-   <http://opendap.org/>

Unstructured Query Language
---------------------------

-   UnQL means Unstructured Query Language. It's an open query language
    for JSON, semi-structured and document databases.
-   <http://www.unqlspec.org/display/UnQL/Home>

UnQL is a query language not a query protocol so provides no information
on how clients and servers interact.

HTSQL
-----

-   <http://htsql.org/>
-   A database query language based on SQL

    -   HTSQL is a URI-based high-level query language for relational
        databases. HTSQL wraps your database with a web service layer,
        translating HTTP requests into SQL and returning results as
        HTML, JSON, etc.

URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/csv Media Type
----------------------------------------------------

-   Method for addressing (and hence possibly querying) into csv
    documents
-   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hausenblas-csv-fragment-00>
-   Status: draft
-   Published: 26 April 2011

Google Visualization API Query Language
---------------------------------------

Another restricted SQL. Has advantage of one existing implementation -
so would immediately work with Google Spreadsheets and Fusion Tables,
presumably? Also

-   <http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage.html#Language_Syntax>

JSONiq
------

JSONiq extends XQuery, a mature W3C standard, with native JSON support.
Like XQuery and SQL, JSONiq is declarative: Expressions can nest with
full composability.

-   <http://www.jsoniq.org/>

Notes: as of Autumn 2012 lacks implementations in any mainstream
language.
