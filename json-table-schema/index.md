# Concepts

A Table consists of a set of rows. Each row has a set of fields
(columns). We usually expect that each Row has the same set of fields
and thus we can talk about *the* fields for the table as a whole.

In cases of tables in spreadsheets or CSV files we often interpret the
first row as a header row giving the names of the fields. By contrast,
in other situations, e.g. tables in SQL databases the fields (columns)
are explicitly designated.

To illustrate here's a classic spreadsheet table:

    field     field
      |         |
      |         |
      V         V

     A     |    B    |    C    |    D      <--- Row
     ------------------------------------
     valA  |   valB  |  valC   |   valD    <--- Row
     ...

In JSON a table would be:

    [
      { "A": value, "B": value, ... },
      { "A": value, "B": value, ... },
      ...
    ]

# Specification

A JSON Table Schema consists of:

* a required list of _field descriptors_
* optionally, a _primary key_ description
* optionally, a _foreign _key_ description

A schema is described using JSON. This might exist as a standalone document
or may be embedded within another JSON structure, e.g. as part of a
data package description.

## Schema

A schema has the following structure:

    {
      # fields is an ordered list of field descriptors
      # one for each field (column) in the table
      "fields": [
        # a field-descriptor
        {
          "name": "name of field (e.g. column name)",
          "title": "A nicer human readable label or title for the field",
          "type": "A string specifying the type",
          "format": "A string specifying a format",
          "description": "A description for the field"
          ...
        },
        ... more field descriptors
      ],
      # (optional) specification of the primary key
      "primaryKey": ...
      # (optional) specification of the foreign keys
      "foreignKeys": ...

    }

That is, a JSON Table Schema is:

-   a Hash which `MUST` contain a key `fields`
-   `fields` MUST be an array where each entry in the array is a field
    descriptor. (Structure and usage described below)
-   the Hash `MAY` contain an attribute `primaryKey` (structure and usage
    specified below)
-   the Hash `MAY` contain an attribute `foreignKeys` (structure and usage
    specified below)

## Field Descriptors

A field descriptor is a simple JSON hash that describes a single field. The
descriptor provides additional human-readable documentation for a field, as
well as additional information that may be used to validate the field or create
a user interface for data entry.

At a minimum a field descriptor will contain at least a `name` key, but MAY
have additional keys as described below:

    {
      "name": "name of field (e.g. column name)",
      "title": "A nicer human readable label or title for the field",
      "type": "A string specifying the type",
      "format": "A string specifying a format",
      "description": "A description for the field",
      "constraints": {
          # a constraints-descriptor
      }
    }

-   a field descriptor MUST be a Hash
-   the field descriptor Hash MUST contain a `name` attribute. This
    attribute `SHOULD` correspond to the name of field/column in the
    data file (if it has a name). As such it `SHOULD` be unique (though
    it is possible, but very bad practice, for the data file to have
    multiple columns with the same name). Additionally, `name` `SHOULD`
    be considered case sensitive. In practice, case sensistivity for names
    can be limiting in certain scenarios, so consumers `MAY` choose to ignore
    case sensitivity for `name` values.
-   the field descriptor Hash MAY contain any number of other attributes
-   specific attributes that MAY be included in the Hash and whose
    meaning is defined in this spec are:

    -   `title`: A nicer human readable label or title for the field
    -   `description`: A description for this field e.g. "The recipient of
        the funds"
    -   `type`: The type of the field (string, number etc) - see below for
        more detail. If type is not provided a consumer should assume a type of
        "string".
    -   `format`: A description of the format e.g. "DD.MM.YYYY" for a
        date. See below for more detail.
    -   `constraints`: A constraints descriptor that can be used by consumers
        to validate field values

### Field Constraints

A set of constraints can be associated with a field. These constraints can be used
to validate data against a JSON Table Schema. The constraints might be used by consumers
to validate, for example, the contents of a data package, or as a means to validate
data being collected or updated via a data entry interface.

A constraints descriptor is a JSON hash. It `MAY` contain any of the following
keys.

- `required` -- A boolean value which indicates whether a field must have a value
  in every row of the table. An empty string is considered to be a missing value.
- `minLength` -- An integer that specifies the minimum number of characters for a value
- `maxLength` -- An integer that specifies the maximum number of characters for a value
- `unique` -- A boolean. If `true`, then all values for that field MUST be unique within the
  data file in which it is found. This defines a unique key for a row although a row could
  potentially have several such keys.
- `pattern` -- A regular expression that can be used to test field values. If the regular
  expression matches then the value is valid. Values will be treated as a string of characters.
  It is recommended that values of this field conform to the standard
  [XML Schema regular expression syntax](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#regexs). See also
  [this reference](http://www.regular-expressions.info/xml.html).
- `minimum` -- specifies a minimum value for a field. This is different to `minLength` which
  checks number of characters. A `minimum` value constraint checks whether a field value is greater than
  or equal to the specified value. The range checking depends on the `type` of the field. E.g. an
  integer field may have a minimum value of 100; a date field might have a minimum date. If a
  `minimum` value constraint is specified then the field descriptor `MUST` contain a `type` key
- `maximum` -- as above, but specifies a maximum value for a field.
- `enum` -- An array of values, where each value `MUST` comply with the type and format of the field.
The field value must exactly match a value in the `enum` array.

A constraints descriptor may contain multiple constraints, in which case a consumer `MUST` apply
all the constraints when determining if a field value is valid.

A data file, e.g. an entry in a data package, is considered to be valid if all of its fields are valid
according to their declared `type` and `constraints`.

### Field Types and Formats

A field's `type` attribute is a string indicating the type of this field.

A field's `format` attribute is a string, being a keyword indicating a
format for the field type.

Both `type` and `format` are optional: in a field descriptor, the absence of a
`type` property indicates that the field is of the type "string", and the
absence of a `format` property indicates that the field's type `format` is
"default".

Types are based on the [type set of
json-schema](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03#section-5.1)
with some additions and minor modifications (cf other type lists include
those in [Elasticsearch
types](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/)).

The type and format list is as follows:

* **string**
    * `string` formats:
        * **default**: any valid string. Equivalent to not declaring a format.
        * **email**: A valid email address.
        * **uri**: A valid URI.
        * **binary**: A base64 encoded string representing binary data.
        * **uuid**: A string that is a uuid.

* **number**
    * `number` formats:
        * **default**: any valid number. Equivalent to not declaring a format.
        * **currency**: A number that may include additional currency symbols
          and/or commas/semi-colons.

* **integer**
    * `integer` formats:
        * **default**: any valid integer. Equivalent to not declaring a format.

* **boolean**
    * In addition to primitive types, boolean values can be indicated with the
      following strings:
        * **true**: 'yes', 'y', 'true', 't', '1'
        * **false**: 'no', 'n', 'false', 'f', '0'
    * `boolean` formats:
        * **default**: any valid boolean value or string that indicates a
          boolean value. Equivalent to not declaring a format.


* **null**
    * In addition to primitive null types, null can be indicated with the
      following strings:
        * **null**: 'null', 'none', 'nil', 'nan', '-', ''
    * `null` formats:
        * **default**: Equivalent to not declaring a format.

* **object**
    * `object` formats:
        * **default**: any valid JSON object. Equivalent to not declaring a format.

* **array**
    * `array` formats:
        * **default**: any valid JSON array. Equivalent to not declaring a format.

* **datetime**; **date**; **time**
    * `datetime`, `date` and `time` share the following format options:
        * **default**: An ISO8601 format string. Equivalent to not declaring a format.
          * date: This MUST be in ISO6801 format YYYY-MM-DD
          * datetime: a date-time. This MUST be in ISO 8601 format of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ in UTC time
          * time: a time without a date
        * **any**: Any parsable representation of the type. The implementing
          library can attempt to parse the datetime via a range of strategies.
          An example is `dateutil.parser.parse` from the `python-dateutils`
          library.
        * **fmt:PATTERN**: date/time values in this field conform to
          `PATTERN` where `[PATTERN]` follows the syntax of [standard Python
          / C strptime][strptime]. (That is, values in the this field should be
          parseable by Python / C standard `strptime` using `PATTERN`).
          Example: `fmt:%d %b %y` would correspond to dates like: `30 Nov 14`
          
* **geopoint**
    * `geopoint` formats:
        * **default**: A string of the pattern "lon, lat", where `lon` is the longitude
          and `lat` is the latitude. Equivalent to not declaring a format.
        * **array**: An array of exactly two items, where each item is either a number,
          or a string parsable as a number, and the first item is `lon` and the second
          item is `lat`.
        * **object**: An object with exactly two keys, `lat` and `lon`

* **geojson**
    * `geojson` formats:
        * **default**: A geojson object as per the [GeoJSON spec](http://geojson.org/).
          Equivalent to not declaring a format.
        * **topojson**: A topojson object as per the [TopoJSON spec](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md)

* **any**
    * Any `type` or `format` is accepted.

## Primary Key

A primary key is a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies each row in
the table.

The `primaryKey` entry in the schema Hash is optional. If present it specifies
the primary key for this table.

The `primaryKey`, if present, MUST be:

* Either: an array of strings with each string corresponding to one of the
  field `name` values in the `fields` array (denoting that the primary key is
  made up of those fields). It is acceptable to have an array with a single
  value (indicating just one field in the primary key). Strictly, order of
  values in the array does not matter. However, it is RECOMMENDED that one
  follow the order the fields in the `fields` has as client applications may
  utitlize the order of the primary key list (e.g. in concatenating values
  together).
* Or: a single string corresponding to one of the field `name` values in
  the `fields` array (indicating that this field is the primary key). Note that
  this version corresponds to the array form with a single value (and can be
  seen as simply a more convenient way of specifying a single field primary
  key).

Here's an example:

      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "a"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "primaryKey": "a"

Here's an example with an array primary key:

    "schema": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "a"
        },
        {
          "name": "b"
        },
        {
          "name": "c"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "primaryKey": ["a", "c"]
     }

## Foreign Keys

<div class="alert alert-success">
Foreign Keys by necessity must be able to reference other data objects. These
data objects require a specific structure for the spec to work. This spec
assumes the data objects being referenced are <a href="/data-packages/">Data
Packages</a>. Thus, to use Foreign Keys you must be referencing Data Packages.
</div>

A foreign key is a reference where entries in a given field (or fields) on this
table ('resource' in data package terminology) is a reference to an entry in a
field (or fields) on a separate resource.

The `foreignKeys` attribute, if present, MUST be an Array. Each entry in the
array must be a `foreignKey`. A `foreignKey` MUST be a Hash and:

* `MUST` have an attribute `fields`. `fields` is a string or array specifying the
  field or fields on this resource that form the source part of the foreign
  key. The structure of the string or array is as per `primaryKey` above.
* `MUST` have an attribute `reference` which MUST be a Hash. The Hash
  * `MAY` have an attribute `datapackage`. This attribute is a string being a url or
    name to a datapackage. If absent the implication is that this is a
    reference to a resource within the current data package.
  * `MUST` have an attribute `resource` which is the name of the resource
    within the referenced data package
  * `MUST` have an attribute `fields` which is a string if the outer `fields` is a
    string, else an array of the same length as the outer `fields`, describing the
    field (or fields) references on the destination resource. The structure of
    the string or array is as per `primaryKey` above.

Here's an example:


      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "state"
        }
      ],
      "foreignKeys": [
        {
          "fields": "state"
          "reference": {
            "datapackage": "http://data.okfn.org/data/mydatapackage/",
            "resource": "the-resource",
            "fields": "state_id"
          }
        }
      ]
